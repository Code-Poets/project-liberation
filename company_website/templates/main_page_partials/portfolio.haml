The collaboration started with due diligence for a project acquired from a cheminformatics startup and developed into full-stack work on what is known today as Synthia® — a retrosynthesis software used for analyzing known reactions and novel molecules. The tool is a market leader in its category and features innovative solutions that facilitate the discovery of new medication.

One of our colleagues joined the team as part of the Solidity project: a smart-contract programming language used in Ethereum. After only 3 months, he’s entered the list of top10 contributors to Solidity and made us all extremely proud. We’re excited to see where the project takes us next.

We’ve designated a full backend development team to build the system architecture. Currently, we’re hard at work creating an MVP and very happy to be a part of the cashless movement. Hopefully, soon we’ll be able to easily buy a coffee with cryptocurrencies thanks to Centi.

Despite being completely starstruck we’ve managed to provide frontend development services with a focus on landing pages and server maintenance/administration. Creating a custom widget or optimizing the page size by 40% were great additions. We’ve made a good impression as on the release date only the servers maintained by Code Poets were able to handle the load.

The company has been growing rapidly over the past few years, so we’ve engaged a full-stack development team. Its goal was creating a custom Human Resources Management System — a web application used for managing the employees, agreements and payroll. Needless to say, it’s been our most finger-licking project so far.

Our full-stack development team worked on Concent (a web application — Golem protocol reliability service) and a video transcoding use case. The whole project was funded by one of the first successful ICOs (Initial Coin Offering), which made it twice as interesting and fun.
